# coronavirus_stats

An app that scrapes the coronavirus stats with just one click.


| Requirements              | 
| ------------------------- |
| Python 3.7.x or higher    | 
| BeautifulSoup             |
| Requests                  |
| PyQt5                     |



## How to run

Run this commands (this only works if you have Git installed)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/themiscoding/coronavirus_stats
$ cd coronavirus_stats
$ python main.py

```

From what I've seen this app needs an update and it does not longer work due to some errors.
